Q1. what is OOPs?
ans- OOPs stands for Object-Oriented Programming System. It is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code to manipulate that data.

Q2. what are the key principles of OOPs?
ans- The key principles of OOPs are:

**Encapsulation:** Bundling the data and methods that operate on the data within one unit, e.g., a class.
**Abstraction:** Hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object.
**Inheritance:** Creating new classes from existing ones, allowing for code reuse and the creation of a hierarchical relationship between classes.
**Polymorphism:** Allowing objects to be treated as instances of their parent class rather than their actual class, enabling one interface to be used for a general class of actions.

Q3.what are types of Inheritance?
ans- The types of inheritance in OOPs are:

1. **Single Inheritance**: A class inherits from one superclass.
2. **Multiple Inheritance**: A class inherits from more than one superclass.
3. **Multilevel Inheritance**: A class inherits from a superclass, which in turn inherits from another superclass.
4. **Hierarchical Inheritance**: Multiple classes inherit from a single superclass.
5. **Hybrid Inheritance**: A combination of two or more types of inheritance.
